# Page Selection Modal

A clean, responsive modal for selecting multiple pages with interactive checkboxes.

## How I Built This

### Approach
1. **Problem Understanding**:  
   - Needed a user-friendly way to select multiple pages (like in a CMS or file manager).
   - Wanted "Select All" functionality with smooth toggling.

2. **Solution Design**:  
   - Created an HTML/CSS modal with checkboxes.
   - Used JavaScript to link the "All pages" checkbox with individual ones.
   - Added alerts to confirm selections.

3. **Challenges Faced**:  
   - Making checkboxes sync correctly (all â†” individual).
   - GitHub Pages 404 error (fixed by renaming to `index.html`).
